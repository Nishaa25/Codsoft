# Codsoft

This repository contains three simple, core Java programs developed as part of tasks during an internship with Codsoft. Each program is designed to solve a specific problem using fundamental Java concepts.

Files:

1. *Task 1: Guess the Number Game*
   - This program implements a basic number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. It includes user input validation and provides feedback based on the guessed number (higher or lower).

2. *Task 2: Student Grade Calculator*
   - A program that calculates the grade of a student based on input scores. It takes the student's marks in various subjects and computes the total, average, and assigns a grade based on predefined conditions.

3. *Task 3: ATM Interface*
   - This program simulates a simple ATM interface allowing the user to perform basic operations such as checking account balance, withdrawing funds, depositing money, and exiting the system. It operates through a console-based interface with menu-driven options.

All programs are written in core Java and focus on fundamental concepts such as conditionals, loops, arrays, and user input handling.
